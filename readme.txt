Test Projects for the new Unity Tiny Platform

Howto: Using VCS in a Unity Tiny project is now unstable and waste tons of space. So to clone this:
1. Install Unity 2019.2.b03 (don't try a latest Beta, errors ensue), create a new project there.
2. Go to package manager, enable Experimental Features and add 'Project Tiny'.
3. Now quit Unity and clone the 'Assets' folder from here to the new Project folder.
